# 📊 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical financial data and basic machine learning techniques. It offers a hands-on demonstration of how time-series data can be analyzed, visualized, and used to forecast future stock trends.

## 🧠 Objective

The main objective is to train a predictive model that can estimate future stock prices based on patterns in historical data. It showcases the practical application of regression models in financial forecasting.

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

1. **Importing and Exploring Data**
   - Load stock market data
   - Inspect and clean data (handle null values)

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Plot trends over time (closing price, volume, etc.)
   - Use plots to understand patterns and outliers

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Select relevant features (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume)
   - Create train/test splits

4. **Model Training**
   - Apply regression model (e.g., Linear Regression)
   - Train on historical price data

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compare predictions with actual values
   - Visualize predicted vs. actual stock prices
